I love playing sport and video game because this two activity made me deleted my stress after school Also can have a good connection with each other. I have been to a wonderful school call Liger Leadership Academy, The education model between my school and other school is different because a normals school mostly they study from and book but here we have a different style of learning and it calls project-based learning. I can say that I am funny and the quality of that is giving a really strong relationship between me and my friend. Also, I really like to watch animation because It can help me when I feel upset some animation is romantic and some are not, I also a fan of marval I watch nearly everything in marvel from phase 1 until phase 3 and that help me know a lot from marvel.
