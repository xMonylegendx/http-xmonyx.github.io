        <h3 style="width: 80%">Hydropower processes the energy of falling water to generate electricity. It works from the source of water that falls through the dam. The hydrodam can be constructed anywhere that has a flowing stream of water. Those include river, stream and even the ocean. Thereâ€‹ are four main part in hydropower: </h2>
    <br></br>
       <h3 style="width: 80%">â–¶ Dams are built to store and raise the level of water such as rivers to create flowing water. They can control the flow of water and effectively store the water used to provide energy at any time. </h2>
        <br></br> 
       <h3 style="width: 80%"> â–¶ Turbine is a rotary mechanical device that is one of the main components to produce energy. They spin from the motion of falling water and turn it into mechanical energy. </h2>
        <br></h2>
        <h3 style="width: 80%">â–¶ Generator is connected to the turbine with a long, narrow handle called shaft. When the turbine spin the generator acts the same. It converts mechanical energy from the turbine into electrical energy. </h2>
        <br></br>
        <h3 style="width: 80%">â–¶ Transmission lines conduct the electricity to other transmission line or directly to places that need electricity such as household. </h2>
        <br></br>
        
       <h3 style="width: 80%"> Hydropower creates electricity when the waterâ€‹â€‹ falls from a dam, the water going through Turbines, Turbines are used to convert different types of energy into the rotation while generators convert rotation into electricity. A generator connected to the turbine, so when the turbine spins it causes the generator to spin too. Then it going to convert mechanical energy from the turbine into electric energy. the transformer can step up the electricity or decrease the voltage electricity, it steps up the electricity to let it go far. </h2>
